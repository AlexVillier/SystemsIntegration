# Systems Integration

A simple p5 website where certain elements' positions are controlled by an analog joystick value, controlled by an Arduino Uno. An analog LED on the Uno board reflects the current value of the joystick. A digital button controls the tempo of the music on the p5 website. A digital buzzer sounds in correspondence with the tempo.
